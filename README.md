Diabetes Checker Web App
This is a Diabetes Checker Web Application built using Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. It allows users to input patient data through sliders and provides a diabetes diagnosis using a trained machine learning model. The app also visualizes patient data in comparison to others from the dataset.

Features
Patient Data Input: Users can input personal health data such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age through an interactive sidebar.

Visualization: The app visualizes the patientâ€™s input data against a diabetes dataset, showing how their data compares to others with or without diabetes.

Prediction: Using a Random Forest Classifier, the app predicts whether the user is diabetic or not based on the input data.

Model Accuracy: Displays the accuracy of the machine learning model on the test data.

Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For training and using the machine learning model.
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-checker.git
cd diabetes-checker
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:8501/.

Dataset
The application uses a diabetes dataset that should be included in the root folder of the project as diabetes.csv. This dataset contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: 0 (No Diabetes) or 1 (Diabetes)
Usage
Step 1: Input your personal health data in the sidebar.
Step 2: Click the Submit button.
Step 3: View your prediction and compare your data with others using visualizations.
Screenshots
Data Input: Users can input personal health data using sliders in the sidebar.
Visualization: Visualize how your data compares to others in the dataset.
Prediction: The app shows a clear message on whether you're diabetic or not, along with the model's prediction accuracy.
Future Improvements
Add more machine learning models for prediction comparison.
Provide more personalized health advice based on the predictions.
Enhance visualization with more interactivity.
